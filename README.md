**Under heavy development and not done!**

Convencience library that allows you to specify and get
data from Craft CMS' GraphQL API. It retains TypeScript
information about your data structures. (It does this through
lying to the TypeSystem, but this bugs should be
caught at runtime). Works as a plain JavaScript library as well.

Heavily under developed. Don't recommend using it now.
If you do use it, stipulate specific version numbers since 
I'm not sure it will be stable until 1.0 (if ever).
